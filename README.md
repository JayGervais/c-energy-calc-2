# c-energy-calc-2

C# project created by Jay Gervais for a class assignment in the Object Oriented Software Development (OOSD) program at SAIT.

This Windows Forms app is designed to calculate energy bill charges for various customer types. The functionality is designed in the Customer class, which includes multiple child classes to organize the calculations for each customer type. When data is added to the form by a user, the calculations are performed according to the cutomer type chosen and the information is saved to a text file. Calculations are also updated and displayed to show to total charges amount, total charges per customer type, and the total number of customers that have been added to the system.
